TARDIS is developed by a multidisciplinary team. 

The development of TARDIS and associated software tools are made 
possible through several coordination roles fulfilled by community 
members. This encompasses a broad scope of responsibilities ranging 
from direct package development to communication, distribution, and 
managerial activities. To know about our other members, visit the

### GSoC Org-Admins
Org admins coordinate participation of TARDIS in the Google Summer of Code. They complete all administrative tasks like submitting the application to participate, requesting slots, ensuring that mentors fill out evaluations in a timely fashion, etc. They may also act as mentors simultaneously during the GSoC.

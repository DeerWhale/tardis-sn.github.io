            "project_description": "Carsus currently stores atomic transition data. TARDIS has a new module that transports gamma-rays that are created by nuclear decay. Nuclear decay data are stored by the NNDC in a format that is difficult to read and compile called ENSDF. The NNDC also provides a parser for this data online called \u201cradlist\u201d. This project involves using the ENSDF archives from NNDC and the parser to download, process, and store nuclear decay data for all available isotopes in the Carsus HDF output."
